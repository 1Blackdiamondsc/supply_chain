## Supply chain DApp

## ðŸ”§ Project Diagram:
Smart contracts and blockchain technology have enabled a wide range of new digital relations, as they allow different parties to a transaction to determine and measure certain parameters in a quick, seamless and transparent way.
First created around 2014, with Ethereum, smart contracts at their simplest are a set of precoded instructions that will trigger outputs given specific inputs. The technology means that supply chain breaches or defaults can be automatically notified to all parties involved in a transaction, but requires thoughtful previous analysis of the best and most efficient parameters and the coding of the contract to be effective.
